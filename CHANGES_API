			CHANGES of HDF5 API
			-------------------
			(Updated: June 22, 1998)


Changes Since Version 1.0.0a
----------------------------

1) H5Pset_mpi and H5Pget_mpi no longer have the access_mode
argument.  (that is taken over by transfer template during
data read/write.)

2) new functions H5Pset_xfer and H5Pget_xfer to handle the
specification of independent or collective data transfer_mode
in the dataset transfer properties list.  The properties
list can be used to specify data transfer mode in the H5Dwrite
and H5Dread function calls.
