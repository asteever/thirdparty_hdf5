INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF5-1.2.1 and 
HDF5-1.2.2, and contains information on the platforms where HDF5-1.2.2
was tested(??????????) and known problems in HDF5-1.2.2. For more details check the
HISTORY file in the HDF5 source.

CONTENTS

- Bug fixes since HDF5-1.2.1 
- Known Problems
- Platforms Tested


Features added since HDF5-1.2.1
===============================
   * Added internal free-lists to reduce memory required by the library and
     H5garbage_collect API function

Bug fixes since HDF5-1.2.1
==========================
   * h5dump correctly displays compound datatypes.
   * Corrected an error in h5toh4 which did not convert the 32bits
     int from HDF5 to HDF4 corectly for the T3E platform.
   * Corrected a floating point number conversion error for the
     Cray J90 platform.  The error did not convert the value 0.0
     correctly.
   * h5dump correctly displays the committed copy of predefined types
     correctly.
   * New features added to snapshots.  Use 'snapshot help' to see a
     complete list of features.
   * Fixed error in H5Giterate which was not updating the "index" parameter
     correctly.
   * Fixed error in hyperslab iteration which was not walking through the
     correct sequence of array elements if hyperslabs were staggered in a
     certain pattern
   * Fixed several other problems in hyperslab iteration code.


Known Problems:
==============

o SunOS 5.6 with C WorkShop Compilers 4.2:  Hyperslab selections will 
  fail if library is compiled using optimization of any level.
