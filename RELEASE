Bug fixes since HDF5-1.2.0
==========================

Configuration
-------------

   * The hdf5.h include file was fixed to allow the HDF5 Library to be compiled
     with other libraries/applications that use GNU autoconf. 
   * Configuration for parallel HDF5 was improved. Configure now attempts to
     link with libmpi.a and/or libmpio.a as the MPI libraries by default.
     It also uses "mpirun" to launch MPI tests by default.  It tests to
     link MPIO routines during the configuration stage, rather than failing
     later as before.  One can just do "./configure --enable-parallel"
     if the MPI library is in the system library.

Dataset region references
-------------------------

    * Error was fixed which was not allowing dataset region references to have
      their regions retrieved correctly.

Tools
------

    * Added an option, -V, to show the version information of h5dump.
    * Fixed a core dumping bug of h5toh4 when executed on platforms like 
      TFLOPS.
    * The test script for h5toh4 used to not able to detect the hdp
      dumper command was not valid.  It now detects and reports the
      failure of hdp execution.

Documentation
-------------

    * User's Guide and Reference Manual were updated. 
      See doc/html/PSandPDF/index.html for more details.
