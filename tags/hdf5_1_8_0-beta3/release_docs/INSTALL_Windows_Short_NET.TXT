      header path                                                          
      (for example, c:\zlib123\include, c:\szip\include)                   
      from the directory list, add the header path                         
      (c:\zlib123\include, c:\szip\include) to the                         
      included directories.                                                
                                                                         
      Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files",         
      If you cannot find your Zlib and Szip library path

      from the directory list, add the library path                        
      (c:\zlib123\lib, c:\szip\dll) to the library directories.            

========================================================================
                Building HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with VS 2005
========================================================================
 
    Note: These extra steps on apply to Visual Studio 2005.  If you will be
          building with .Net 2003, please skip to the section below.
 
     The building procedure is almost the same as building HDF5 on .Net 2003.

     1) To use zlib or szlib compression packages:
        Use zlib 1.2.2 DLL provided at
        ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/zlib/1.2/bin/zlib123-windows.zip
        Use szlib 2.0 DLL provided at
        ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/szip/2.0/bin/windows/xp-net
     2) Make sure that WIN32 macro is set at Visual Studio 2005.
     3) You may use _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE to disable the warnings.
     Please refer to the next section, "Building HDF5 C/C++ Libraries 
     with VS .NET"
     
     Please also note that the example workspace may not work properly. 
     You may need to reset hdf5 library path.
 
 
========================================================================
                Building HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with VS .NET
========================================================================

   1. Run batch file copy_hdf.bat

      Go to  c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows and run copy_hdf.bat. This process will 
      copy all the necessary batch files, windows specific source codes and 
      text files saved under c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows directory to the 
      corresponding directories under hdf5.

   2. Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio compiler

      Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio.  From the main menu, go to "File" and 
      select the "Open Solution" option. Then open the
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows\proj\all\all.sln solution if you are building
      without Fortran libraries, or 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows\proj\all_fortran\all_fortran.sln if you would
      like to use Fortran.

      You should find Windows project files listed as "all", "big", etc. on the
      left.


   3. (Optional) Disable HDF5 C++ and High level C++
   
      In HDF5 1.8, C++ and HL C++ libraries are built by default.  To opt-out,
      you must explicitly disable them.

      3.1 Skip this step if you do want to build HDF5 High-Level C++ libraries

          Go to "Project" and select "Project Dependencies".  Select "all", and 
          disable all of the following projects:

            hdf5_hl_cpp
            hdf5_hl_cppdll
            hl_test_table_cpp
            hl_test_table_cppdll
      
      3.2 Skip this step if you do want to build HDF5 High-Level libraries

          Go to "Project" and select "Project Dependencies".  Select "all", and 
          disable all of the project files listed in the previous step, as well
          as the following projects:

             hdf5_hl
             hdf5_hldll
             hl_test_image
             hl_test_imagedll
             hl_test_lite
             hl_test_litedll
             hl_test_table
             hl_test_tabledll
             hl_test_ds
             hl_test_dsdll
             hl_test_packet
             hl_test_packetdll
   
   Click on "OK", From the main menu, choose "Build"-> "Build" or  
   "Rebuild ALL" to build both release and debug version of HDF5   
   Libraries.                                                                                           
             

   4. Select "Build", then Select "Configuration Manager".

      4.1 To build debug static libraries, debug multithreaded DLLs, and tests:

      In "Active Solution Configuration", select "Debug". Select "Close". 
      Select "Build" -> "Build Solution" or "Rebuild Solution" to build debug 
      version of project "all".

      4.2 To build release static libraries, multithreaded DLLs and tests:

      In "Active Solution Configuration", select "Release". Select "Close". 
      Select "Build" -> "Build Solution" or "Rebuild Solution" to build release 
      version of project "all".

      Both debug and release versions must be built.

      Warning messages can be ignored.
             
========================================================================
               Testing HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with VS .NET
========================================================================

HDF5 libraries and tools should be tested to make sure that they were
built correctly. c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5check.bat was provided to test
HDF5 libraries and tools.

hdf5check.bat has four options:
   
   hdf5check                     test HDF5 C library and tools only
      
   hdf5check enablecpp           test HDF5 C/C++ libraries and tools
         
   hdf5check enablefortran       test HDF5 C/Fortran libraries and tools
         
   hdf5check enableall           test HDF5 C/C++/Fortran libraries and tools
   

Notes: Users who only build HDF5 C/C++ libraries ONLY have the first 
       two options.

Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with appropriate
options.

Test results are saved in two files:

   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt   

   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\check_results.txt.

In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.  If all the
tests passed, then you do not have to check check_results.txt.  
If some tests failed, check check_results.txt can help you
figure out what was wrong.

If you want to test HDF5 libraries and tools one by one, please refer to
Section II, step 2 in INSTALL_Windows.txt.


========================================================================
                    Installing HDF5 C/C++ Libraries
========================================================================

Run the batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\installhdf5lib.bat to install 
all HDF5 libraries and tools into c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib directory.

========================================================================
               Building HDF5 Examples and Applications
========================================================================

Building HDF5 Examples is Optional. Please read Section II, step 4 and 
the following part in INSTALL_Windows.txt for detailed information.
