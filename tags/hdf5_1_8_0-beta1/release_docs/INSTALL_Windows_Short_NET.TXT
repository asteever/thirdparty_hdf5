Notes: This short instruction is written for users who want to quickly
       build HDF5 library and tools from the HDF5 source code package
       with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 or 2005 but do not want 
       to know HDF5 building and installation details on Windows XP.
         
       For detailed HDF5 build and install information, or if you have
       trouble following any steps in the instructions, please refer to
       INSTALL_Windows.txt for further information.
      
       For users who would like to build and test HDF5 package from the
       command line, please refer to
       INSATLL_Windows_From_Command_Line.txt.

       For .Net and Intel users, If  you are not building HDF5 with 
       Thread-Safe Feature, ttsafedll.dsp should always be turned off.
        
WARNINGS:

Please read CAREFULLY about HDF5 build and install preconditions and 
notes in INSTALL_Windows.txt before starting below procedures.

                            Preconditions                                                           
========================================================================                          

   1. Setup path Visual Studio .Net 2003 Compiler.  
   
      Open "System" in Control Panel.
   
      On the "Advanced" tab, click "Environment Variables", click 
      "Path" in the "System variables" box, then click "Edit" and 
      add your Visual C++ .Net path (For example, 
      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Common7\IDE)
      into "Variable Value" and click "OK".                          
                                                                         
   2. Set up path for external libraries and headers                     
                                                                         
      Skip this part if you don't want to use ANY compression features     
      provided by HDF5.  Please do read Section V in INSTALL_Windows.txt.                         
                                                                         
      You have to read this part even if you want to only use Zlib         
      or Szip.  You also need to read Section V in INSTALL_Windows.txt.                           
                                                                         
      Invoke Microsoft Visual C++ .Net and go to "Tools" and select             
      "Options". In the left pane of  "Option" window poped up,
      choose and expand "Projects", Click on "VC++ Directories".
      In the right pane, Find the box "Show directories for", choose                          
      "Include files", if you can not find your Zlib and Szip              
      header path                                                          
      (for example, c:\zlib123\include, c:\szip\include)                   
      from the directory list, add the header path                         
      (c:\zlib123\include, c:\szip\include) to the                         
      included directories.                                                
                                                                         
      Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files",         
      If you cannot find your Zlib and Szip library path                   
      (for example, c:\zlib123\lib, c:\szip\dll)                           
      from the directory list, add the library path                        
      (c:\zlib123\lib, c:\szip\dll) to the library directories.            

========================================================================
                Building HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with VS 2005
========================================================================
 
    Note: These extra steps on apply to Visual Studio 2005.  If you will be
          building with .Net 2003, please skip to the section below.
 
     The building procedure is almost the same as building HDF5 on .Net 2003.

     1) To use zlib or szlib compression packages:
        Use zlib 1.2.2 DLL provided at
        ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/zlib/1.2/bin/zlib123-windows.zip
        Use szlib 2.0 DLL provided at
        ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/szip/2.0/bin/windows/xp-net
     2) Make sure that WIN32 macro is set at Visual Studio 2005.
     3) You may use _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE to disable the warnings.
     Please refer to the next section, "Building HDF5 C/C++ Libraries 
     with VS .NET"
     
     Please also note that the example workspace may not work properly. 
     You may need to reset hdf5 library path.
 
 
========================================================================
                Building HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with VS .NET
========================================================================

1. Run copy_hdf.bat

   Go to directory hdf5/windows/, run the batch file copy_hdf.bat to 
   copy the nessary files to the directory where they will be used.

2. Open all.dsw workspace

   In the pop up window, choose "Yes To All" to convert all project 
   files to Visual C++ .Net project format.
   
   Notes: all.sln is for command use only. Please open all.dsw 
          not all.sln.

   Invoke Microsoft Visual C++ .Net 2003.  From the main        
   menu, go to "File" and select "Open Solution". In            
   the "Open Solution" window, Change "Files of type" to        
   "All Project Files". Choose "all.dsw" under the directory    
   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows\proj\all. In the pop up window,   
   choose "Yes To All" to convert all project files to Visual  
   C++ .Net project format.                                     

3. Disable Fortran project files

   Assumption: If there is no intel fortran compiler integrated with
               VS .Net 2003, you need to disable all of the fortran
               project files.

               If you want to use intel fortran compiler to build
               HDF5 fortran project files, please read the instruction
               INSTALL_Windows.txt or INSTALL_Windows_Short_Intel.txt.
   
   Go to "Build" and select "Configuration Manager". Choose "Release"
   or "Debug" under "Active Solution Configuration"

   Disable the following projects:

        flush1_fortran
        flush1_fortrandll
        flush2_fortran
        flush2_fortrandll
        hdf5_f90cstub
        hdf5_f90cstubdll
        hdf5_fortran
        hdf5_fortrandll
        libtest_cstubdll
        libtest_fortran
        libtest_fortrandll
        testhdf5_fortran
        testhdf5_fortrandll
        hdf5_hl_fortran
        hdf5_hl_fortrandll
        hdf5_hl_f90cstubdll
        hl_test_image_fortran
        hl_test_image_fortrandll
        hl_test_lite_fortran
        hl_test_lite_fortrandll
        hl_test_table_fortran
        hl_test_table_fortrandll

========================================================================
               Testing HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with VS .NET
========================================================================

HDF5 libraries and tools should be tested to make sure that they were
built correctly. c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5check.bat was provided to test
HDF5 libraries and tools.

hdf5check.bat has four options:
   
   hdf5check                     test HDF5 C library and tools only
      
   hdf5check enablecpp           test HDF5 C/C++ libraries and tools
         
   hdf5check enablefortran       test HDF5 C/Fortran libraries 
                                 and tools
         
   hdf5check enableall           test HDF5 C/C++/Fortran libraries
                                 and tools
   

Notes: Users who only build HDF5 C/C++ libraries ONLY have the first 
       two options.

Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with appropriate
options.

Test results are saved in two files:

   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt   

   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\check_results.txt.

In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.  If all the
tests passed, then you do not have to check check_results.txt.  
If some tests failed, check check_results.txt can help you
figure out what was wrong.

If you want to test HDF5 libraries and tools one by one, please refer to
Section II, step 2 in INSTALL_Windows.txt.


========================================================================
                    Installing HDF5 C/C++ Libraries
========================================================================

Run the batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\installhdf5lib.bat to install 
all HDF5 libraries and tools into c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib directory.

========================================================================
               Building HDF5 Examples and Applications
========================================================================

Building HDF5 Examples is Optional. Please read Section II, step 4 and 
the following part in INSTALL_Windows.txt for detailed information.
