		hdf5/testpar/README
		-------------------
		(last update: Feb 16 1998)

This directory holds tests for the parallel HDF5 library.  It is in
its "infancy" and is not integrated with the rest of the HDF5 software
yet.  It will be smothed out in the next release.

Steps to compile and test:

1) Makefile.irix64 is one that works for IRIX64 -64 platform.
   You may use it as a template to create Makefile for other platforms.

2) "make all" creates two tests.  testphdf5 uses parallel I/O access
   while shdf5 does the same tests but uses the default sequential I/O
   access.

3) "make test" runs both tests.
