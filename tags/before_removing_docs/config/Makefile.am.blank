## Makefile.am
## Run automake to generate a Makefile.in from this file.
#
# HDF5 Library Makefile(.in)
#

## Makefile.am template
## When automake is run, it scans configure.in to find all Makefiles used by
## the build that come from Makefile.in files.  If there are Makefile.am's 
## in any of those locations, it parses the Makefile.am's to produce Makefile.in's,
## which configure uses to create Makefiles.
##
## Comments in the Makefile.am with two pound signs will be stripped by automake,
## comments with one pound sign will be passed through to the Makefile.in.
##
## Almost all Makefile.am's in hdf5 include commence.am and conclude.am; these
## files are treated as if they were included textually in the Makefile.am when
## automake processes it.  Commence.am also includes a (mostly) comprehensive
## list of make targets.
