		hdf5/testpar/README
		-------------------
		(last update: Aug the 1998)

This directory holds tests for the parallel HDF5 library.  It is in
its "infancy" and is not integrated with the rest of the HDF5 software
yet.  It will be smothed out in the next release.

Steps to compile and test:

1a) Makefile.irix64 is one that works for IRIX64 -64 platform.
    You may use it as a template to create Makefile for other platforms.

1b) Makefile.ascired is one that works for the ASCI Red platform.

2) "make all -f Makefile.xxxxx >&! make.out1" creates testphdf5.

3) "make test -f Makefile.xxxxx >&! make.out2" runs testphdf5.

    When running "make test -f Makefile.xxxxx" the line that executes is:
    $(RUN) testphdf5 $(TEST_FLAGS)
    
    For the ASCI Red users:
      In the file Makefile.ascired, the variables RUN and TEST_FLAGS are:

      RUN=yod -sz 8
      TEST_FLAGS=-f "pfs:/pfs/multi/tmp_1/your_own"
    
      The TEST_FLAGS variable contains an optional file prefix which needs
      to be changed to your own Intel PFS directory name.
 
      /* change "your_own" to your own directory name */
 
      RUN=yod -sz 8
      TEST_FLAGS=-f "pfs:/pfs/multi/tmp_1/my_dir"

      After the above change to Makefile.ascired, upon execution of
      "make test -f Makefile.ascired >&! make.out2",
      the prefix will be attached to filenames in testphdf5 at execution.
