New Features
============

	Configuration
	-------------

        - Configuration suite now uses Autoconf 2.61, Automake 1.10.1, and 
          Libtool 2.2.2 (MAM - 2008/05/01)

        - The new configure option "--disable-sharedlib-rpath" disables 
          embedding the '-Wl,-rpath' information into executables when 
          shared libraries are produced, and instead solely relies on the 
          information in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (MAM - 2008/05/15)

	Source code distribution
	========================

	Library
	-------
        
        - None

	Parallel Library
	----------------
        
        - None

	Tools
	-----
        - h5dump: add a printing of the compression ratio of uncompressed and compressed 
           sizes for cases where compression  filters are present. (PVN - 2008/05/01)
        - h5dump: added an option to allow a user defined formatting string for printf 
           regarding floating point numbers. (PVN - 2008/05/06)
        - h5dump: support for external links, display the object that the external link 
           points to. (PVN - 2008/05/12)
        - h5repack: added back -o and -i command line flags to specify input and
          output files. (PVN - 2008/05/23)




	F90 API
	------

        New H5A, H5G, H5L, H5O, and H5P APIs to enable 1.8 features were
	added. See Changes.html (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/Changes.html) 
	file for the complete list of the new APIs.

	C++ API
	------
        
        - None




Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================

	- Fortran library will work correctly if compiled with -i8 flag; 
	  tested with g95, PGI and Intel Fortran compilers.

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.0 
==========================

	Configuration
	-------------
        
        - None

	Source code distribution
	========================

	Library
	-------
            - Chunked > 4GB are disallowed. (QAK - 2008/05/16)
	    - Fixed the problem with the searching of target file for H5Lcreate_external().
	      The searching pattern will depend on whether the target file's
	      pathname is an absolute or a relative path. Please see the
	      description in the RM for H5Lcreate_external().  (VC - 4/8/08)
            - Fixed possible file corruption bug when encoding datatype
                descriptions for compound datatypes whose size was between
                256 & 511 bytes and the file was opened with the "use the
                latest format" property enabled (with H5Pset_libver_bounds).
                (QAK - 2008/03/13)
            - Fixed bug in H5Aget_num_attrs() routine to handle invalid location
                ID correctly.  (QAK - 2008/03/11)


	Parallel Library
	----------------
        
        - None

	Tools
	-----
            - Fixed bug in h5diff that prevented datasets & attributes with
                variable-length string elements from comparing correctly.
                (QAK - 2008/02/28)
            - Fixed bug in h5dump that caused binary output to be made
                only for the first dataset, when several datasets were requested
                (PVN - 2008/04/07)

	F90 API
	------

	- h5tset(get)_fields subroutines were missing parameter to specify
	  a sign position; fixed (EIP - 2008/05/23)
	- Many APIs were fixed to work with the 8 byte integer in Fortran vs.
	  4 byte integer in C; this change is trasparent to user's
	  application.

	C++ API
	------

	- The class hierarchy was revised to address the problem reported
	  in bugzilla #1068.  Classes AbstractDS and Attribute are moved out of
   	  H5Object.  Class Attribute now multiply inherits from IdComponent and
   	  AbstractDs and class DataSet from H5Object and AbstractDs.

   	  In addition, data member IdComponent::id was moved into subclasses:
   	  Attribute, DataSet, DataSpace, DataType, H5File, Group, and PropList.

   	- Revised Attribute::write and Attribute::read
   	  wrappers to handle memory allocation/deallocation properly. (bugzilla 1045)
          (BMR - 2008/05/20)

Known Problems
==============
* We have discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 
  tests with chunking storage on the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a 
  Linux cluster at NCSA.

  Under some complex selection cases: 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  These issues arise only when turning on collective IO with chunking storage 
  with some complex selections. We have not found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this behavior, change the following line in your code
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);

  to
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);

  KY - 2007/08/24

* For SNL, spirit/liberty/thunderbird: The serial tests pass but parallel
  tests failed with MPI-IO file locking message. AKC - 2007/6/25

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* For SNL, Red Storm: Only parallel HDF5 is supported.  The serial tests pass
  when run against the parallel library; the parallel tests also pass, but
  with lots of non-fatal error messages.

* For LLNL, uP: both serial and parallel tests pass.  
  Zeus: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail with a known problem in MPI.
  ubgl: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail. 

* Configuring with --enable-debug=all produces compiler errors on most
  platforms:  Users who want to run HDF5 in debug mode should use
  --enable-debug rather than --enable-debug=all to enable debugging
  information on most modules.

* On Mac OS 10.4, test/dt_arith.c has some errors in conversion from long
  double to (unsigned) long long and from (unsigned) long long to long double. 

* On Altix SGI with Intel 9.0, testmeta.c would not compile with -O3
  optimization flag.

* On VAX, the Scaleoffset filter is not supported. The filter cannot be 
  applied to HDF5 data generated on VAX. The Scaleoffset filter only supports 
  the IEEE standard for floating-point data.

* On Cray X1, a lone colon on the command line of h5dump --xml (as in
  the testh5dumpxml.sh script) is misinterpereted by the operating system
  and causes an error.

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* On IRIX6.5, when the C compiler version is greater than 7.4, complicated
  MPI derived datatype code will work. However, the user should increase
  the value of the MPI_TYPE_MAX environment variable to some appropriate value 
  to use collective irregular selection code.  For example, the current 
  parallel HDF5 test needs to raise MPI_TYPE_MAX to 200,000 to pass the test. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculating code of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* For version 6 (6.02 and 6.04) of the Portland Group compiler on the AMD 
  Opteron processor, there is a bug in the compiler for optimization(-O2).  
  The library failed in several tests, all related to the MULTI driver.  
  The problem has been reported to the vendor.  

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system libraries on 
  Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine with 
  this option.
  
  It is suggested that you do not use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* With the gcc 2.95.2 compiler, HDF5 uses the `-ansi' flag during
  compilation. The ANSI version of the compiler complains about not being
  able to handle the `long long' datatype with the warning:

        warning: ANSI C does not support `long long'
  
  This warning is innocuous and can be safely ignored.

* The ./dsets tests fail on the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The HDF5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Not all platforms behave correctly with Szip's shared libraries. Szip is
  disabled in these cases, and a message is relayed at configure time. Static
  libraries should be working on all systems that support Szip and should be
  used when shared libraries are unavailable. 

  There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* On some platforms that use Intel and Absoft compilers to build the HDF5 
  Fortran library, compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 
  and fflush2.f90 complaining about the exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error).

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  the INSTALL file sections 4.7 and 4.8.

* On at least one system, SDSC DataStar, the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run 
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as 
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.  

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to 
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after 
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it 
  for your installation.  

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item 
  on the command line which executes the the test.  The script then 
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF5 make files and test scipts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the 
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to 
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can 
  can prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.

* H5Ocopy() does not copy reg_ref attributes correctly when shared-message
  is turn on. The value of the reference in the destination attriubte is
  wrong. This H5Ocopy problem will affect the h5copy tool.
