	    Installation instructions for Parallel HDF5
	    -------------------------------------------
		(last updated: May 21, 1999)

1. Overview
-----------
This file contains instructions for the installation of parallel
HDF5.  Platforms supported by this release are SGI Origin 2000,
IBM SP2, and the Intel TFLOP.  The steps are kind of unnatural and
will be more automized in the next release.   If you have difficulties
installing the software in your system, please send mail to
	hdfparallel@ncsa.uiuc.edu
In your mail, please enclose the output of "uname -a".  Also attach the
content of "config.log" if you have run the "configure" command.

First, you must obtain and unpack the HDF5 source as
described in the file INSTALL.  You also need to obtain the
information of the include and library paths of MPI and MPIO
software installed in your system since the parallel HDF5 library
uses them for parallel I/O access.


2. Quick Instruction for known systems
--------------------------------------
The following shows particular steps to run the parallel HDF5
configure for a few machines we tested.  If your particular platform
is not shown or somehow the steps do not work for yours, please go
to the next section for more detail explanations.

IBM SP2: follow the instructions in INSTALL.ibm.sp.parallel.

TFLOPS: follow the instuctions in INSTALL.ascired.

SGI Origin 2000:
Cray T3E:
(where MPI-IO is part of system MPI library such as mpt 1.3)

#!/bin/sh

RUNPARALLEL="mpirun -np 2"
export RUNPARALLEL
LIBS="-lmpi"
export LIBS
./configure --enable-parallel --disable-shared --prefix=$PWD/installdir
make
make check
make install


SGI Origin 2000:
Cray T3E:
(where MPI-IO is not part of system MPI library or I want to
use my own version of MPIO)


mpi1_inc=""                                     #mpi-1 include
mpi1_lib=""                                     #mpi-1 library
mpio_inc=-I$HOME/ROMIO/include                  #mpio include
mpio_lib="-L$HOME/ROMIO/lib/IRIX64"             #mpio library

MPI_INC="$mpio_inc $mpi1_inc"
MPI_LIB="$mpio_lib $mpi1_lib"

#for version 1.1
CPPFLAGS=$MPI_INC
export CPPFLAGS
LDFLAGS=$MPI_LIB
export LDFLAGS
RUNPARALLEL="mpirun -np 2"
export RUNPARALLEL
LIBS="-lmpio -lmpi"
export LIBS

./configure --enable-parallel --disable-shared --prefix=$PWD/installdir
make
make check
make install
