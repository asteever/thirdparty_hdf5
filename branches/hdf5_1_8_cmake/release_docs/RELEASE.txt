New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Autotools: Automake updated to 1.14.1 (ADB - 2014/04/08)
    - CMake: Moved minimum CMake version to 2.8.11 which enables better library
      include processing. (ADB - 2014/03/26)
    
    Library
    -------
    - Added an H5free_memory API call. This should be used to free memory that
      has been allocated by HDF5 API calls (e.g., H5Tget_member_name,
      H5Pget_class_name, etc.). The main motivation for this call is Windows,
      where it is common for application code and the HDF5 library to be using
      different C run-time libraries. Using the new call ensures that the same
      CRT handles both the allocation and free. This new function can also be
      useful in any case where the library uses a different memory manager
      than the application, such as when a debug memory manager is in use or
      when the HDF5 library is wrapped for use in a managed language like
      Python or Java. Fixes HDFFV-7710, 8519, and 8851. (DER - 2014/04/11)
    - The core VFD can now be configured to track dirty regions in the file
      and only write out the changed regions on flush/close. Additionally,
      a "page aggregation" size can be set that will aggregate small writes
      into larger writes. e.g., setting a 1 MiB page aggregation size will
      logically partition the the in-memory file into 1 MiB pages that will be
      written out in their entirety if even a single byte is dirtied. The
      feature is controlled via the new H5Pset/get_core_write_tracking() API
      call. A new "core_paged" target has been added to the check-vfd target
      in test/Makefile.am that exercises the feature over all HDF5 VFD-aware
      tests. (DER - 2014/04/12)
 
    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Removed MPI-POSIX VFD, as it wasn't helping anyone and was just
        generating support questions.  Application developers performing
        parallel I/O should always use the MPI-IO VFD.  (QAK - 2014/03/28)
    - Improved parallel I/O support to allow collective I/O on point
        selections. (QAK - 2014/03/15)

Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard is not supported by Apple any more. In view of
    the added support of Mac OS X 10.9, Mac OS X 10.6 is retired from HDF5
    supported platforms. (AKC - 2014/03/14 HDFFV-8704)

    Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks is supported. (AKC - 2014/03/04 HDFFV-8694)
                                  

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.12
===========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - CMake: When CMake commands are executed individually on the command line
      and the external filters are being built, the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE define
      must be set to the same value as the configuration
        (-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release if using -C Release). This is needed 
      by the the szip and zlib filter build commands. (ADB - HDFFV-8695)
    - CMake: Remove use of XLATE_UTILITY program. (ADB - 2014/03/28 HDFFV-8640)
    - CMake: Added missing quotes in setting the CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS for the
      MPI option. (ADB - 2014/02/27 HDFFV-8674)
    - It is no longer necessary to specify --with-pthreads with
      --enable-threadsafe if the Pthreads library is in a standard location.
      Fixes HDFFV-8693. (DER - 2014/04/11)
    - CMake: C++ and/or Fortran + thread-safe is enforced as a non-supported
      configuration, which matches the autotools. (DER - 2014/04/11)
    - CMake: Static + thread-safe + Win32 threads is not a supported configuration
      due to the inability to automatically clean up thread-local storage. This is
      expected to be fixed in a future release. In the meantime, a work-around
      that uses internal functionality may allow the combination to be used without
      resource leaks. Contact the help desk for more information.
      (DER - 2014/04/11)
   
    Library
    -------
    - H5Z.c: H5Zfilter_avail(H5Z_filter_t id)
      Added else block if the call to the internal H5Z_filter_avail(id) does not
      fail and returns FALSE. This block calls the H5PL_load(H5PL_TYPE_FILTER, (int)id)
      function to attempt to dynamically load the filter plugin. 
      (ADB - 2014/03/03 HDFFV-8629)
    - The thread-safe library now no longer leaks thread-local storage
      resources on Windows with Win32 threads. This cleanup can only be
      performed when the library is built as a shared library so thread-safe
      + Win32 threads + static is no longer a supported configuration. Fixes
      HDFFV-8518. (DER - 2014/04/11)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None

    Performance
    -------------
    - None

    Tools
    -----
    - h5repack: h5repack would not attempt to remove UD filters. Added a 
      check to h5repack for UD filters that checks if the filter can 
      be dynamically loaded. This will require a change in the library to
      add the H5PL_load() to the H5Zfilter_avail(). (ADB - 2014/03/03 HDFFV-8629)

    Testing
    -------
    - testhdf5 now exits EXIT_SUCCESS(0) if no errors, else EXIT_FAILURE(1).
      (AKC - 2014/01/27 - HDFFV-8572)

    - The big test now pays attention to the HDF5_DRIVER environment variable.
      Previously, it would run all tests with the family, stdio, and sec2
      VFDs for each VFD in the check-vfd make target, regardless of the
      variable setting. It now checks the variable and either runs the
      appropriate VFD-specific tests or skips, as needed. This saves much
      testing time. Fixes HDFFV-8554. (DER - 2014/04/11)

Known Problems
==============
* CLANG compiler with the options -fcatch-undefined-behavior and -ftrapv
  catches some undefined behavior in the alignment algorithm of the macro DETECT_I
  in H5detect.c (Issue 8147).  Since the algorithm is trying to detect the alignment
  of integers, ideally the flag -fcatch-undefined-behavior shouldn't to be used for
  H5detect.c. In the future, we can separate flags for H5detect.c from the rest of
  the library. (SLU - 2013/10/16)

* Make provided by Solaris fails in "make check". Solaris users should use
  gmake to build and install the HDF5 software. (AKC - 2013/10/08 - HDFFV-8534)

* On OpenVMS, two soft conversion functions (H5T__conv_i_f and H5T__conv_f_i)
  have bugs.  They convert data between floating-point numbers and integers.
  But the library's default is hard conversion.  The user should avoid
  explicitly enabling soft conversion between floating-point numbers and
  integers. (Issue VMS-8; SLU - 2013/09/19)

* On OpenVMS, ZLIB 1.2.8 library doesn't work properly.  ZLIB 1.2.5 works
  fine.  So please use ZLIB 1.2.5 to build HDF5 library. (Issue VMS-5;
  SLU 2013/09/19)  

* When building using the Cray compilers on Cray machines, HDF5
  configure mistakenly thinks the compiler is an intel compiler and
  sets the -std=c99 flag which breaks configure on Cray. To build HDF5
  properly on a Cray machine, please consult with the instructions in
  INSTALL_parallel for building on Hopper.
  (MSC - 2013/04/26 - HDFFV-8429)

* The h5dump and h5diff utilities occasionally produce different output
  between Linux and Windows systems. This is caused by lower-level library
  routines that fail to write fill values to the user's buffer when reading
  unallocated chunks from datasets that have a fill value set to
  H5D_FILL_VALUE_DEFAULT. Due to platform differences the return of
  spurious data values has only been encountered on Windows 32-bit systems.
  (Issue HDFFV-8247; JP - 2013/03/27)

* The 5.9 C++ compiler on Sun failed to compile a C++ test ttypes.cpp.  It 
  complains with this message:
      "/home/hdf5/src/H5Vprivate.h", line 130: Error: __func__ is not defined.
  
  The reason is that __func__ is a predefined identifier in C99 standard.  The
  HDF5 C library uses it in H5private.h.  The test ttypes.cpp includes 
  H5private.h (H5Tpkg.h<-H5Fprivate.h<-H5Vprivate.h<-H5private.h).  Sun's 5.9
  C++ compiler doesn't support __func__, thus fails to compile the C++ test.
  But Sun's 5.11 C++ compiler does.  To check whether your Sun C++ compiler 
  knows this identifier, try to compile the following simple C++ program:
      #include<stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          printf("%s\n", __func__);
          return 0;
      }
  (SLU - 2012/11/5)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD with the
  native release 8.2 compilers (4.2.1), but are working with gcc 4.6 from the
  ports (and probably gcc releases after that).
  (QAK - 2012/10/19)

* The following h5dump test case fails in BG/P machines (and potentially other
  machines that use a command script to launch executables):

   h5dump --no-compact-subset -d "AHFINDERDIRECT::ah_centroid_t[0] it=0 tl=0"
     tno-subset.h5
  
  This is due to the embedded spaces in the dataset name being interpreted
  by the command script launcher as meta-characters, thus passing three
  arguments to h5dump's -d flag. The command passes if run by hand, just
  not via the test script.
  (AKC - 2012/05/03)

* On hopper, the build failed when RUNSERIAL and RUNPARALLEL are set
  to aprun -np X, because the H5lib_settings.c file was not generated
  properly. Not setting those environment variables works, because
  configure was able to automatically detect that it's a Cray system
  and used the proper launch commands when necessary. 
  (MSC - 2012/04/18)

* The data conversion test dt_arith.c fails in "long double" to integer
  conversion on Ubuntu 11.10 (3.0.0.13 kernel) with GCC 4.6.1 if the library
  is built with optimization -O3 or -O2.  The older GCC (4.5) or newer kernal
  (3.2.2 on Fedora) doesn't have the problem.  Users should lower the 
  optimization level (-O1 or -O0) by defining CFLAGS in the command line of 
  "configure" like:

      CFLAGS=-O1 ./configure

  This will overwrite the library's default optimization level.
  (SLU - 2012/02/07 - HDFFV-7829)
  This issue is no longer present on Ubuntu 12.10 (3.5.0 kernel) with 
  gcc 4.7.2.

* The STDIO VFD does not work on some architectures, possibly due to 32/64
  bit or large file issues.  The basic STDIO VFD test is known to fail on
  64-bit SunOS 5.10 on SPARC when built with -m64 and 32-bit OS X/Darwin
  10.7.0.  The STDIO VFD test has been disabled while we investigate and
  a fix should appear in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-8235)

* h5diff can report inconsistent results when comparing datasets of enum type
  that contain invalid values.  This is due to how enum types are handled in
  the library and will be addressed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7527)

* The links test can fail under the stdio VFD due to some issues with external
  links.  This will be investigated and fixed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7768)

* After the shared library support was fixed for some bugs, it was discovered
  that "make prefix=XXX install" no longer works for shared libraries. It
  still works correctly for static libraries. Therefore, if you want to
  install the HDF5 shared libraries in a location such as /usr/local/hdf5,
  you need to specify the location via the --prefix option during configure 
  time. E.g, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 ...
  (AKC - 2011/05/07 - HDFFV-7583)

* The parallel test, t_shapesame, in testpar/, may run for a long time and may
  be terminated by the alarm signal.  If that happens, one can increase the
  alarm seconds (default is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes) by setting the
  environment variable, $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS, to a larger value such as 3600
  (60 minutes).  Note that the t_shapesame test may fail in some systems 
  (see the "While working on the 1.8.6 release..." problem below).  If 
  it does, it will waste more time if $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS is set
  to a larger value.
  (AKC - 2011/05/07)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD.
  (QAK - 2011/04/26)

* Shared Fortran libraries are not quite working on AIX. While they are
  generated when --enable-shared is specified, the fortran and hl/fortran
  tests fail. We are looking into the issue. HL and C++ shared libraries
  should now be working as intended, however.
  (MAM - 2011/04/20)

* The --with-mpe configure option does not work with Mpich2.
  (AKC - 2011/03/10)

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or file systems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/
  (NAF - 2011/01/19)

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added in.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug in 1.8 library.  Because there's only one user 
  complaining about it, we (Elena, Quincey, and I) decided to leave it as 
  it is (see bug report #1279).  Quincey will make a plan for 1.10.
  (SLU - 2010/02/02)

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.
  (MAM - 2009/11/04)
  
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO.
  (CMC - 2009/04/28)

* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  (SLU - 2005/06/30)
