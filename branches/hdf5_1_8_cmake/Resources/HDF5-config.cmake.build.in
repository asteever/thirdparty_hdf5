# XXX_INCLUDE_DIRS         The final set of include directories listed in one variable for use by client code.  This should not be a cache entry.
# XXX_LIBRARIES          	 The libraries to link against to use XXX. These should include full paths.  This should not be a cache entry.
# XXX_DEFINITIONS        	 Definitions to use when compiling code that uses XXX. This really shouldn't include options such as (-DHAS_JPEG)that a client source-code file uses to decide whether to #include <jpeg.h>
# XXX_EXECUTABLE         	 Where to find the XXX tool.
# XXX_YYY_EXECUTABLE     	 Where to find the YYY tool that comes with XXX.
# XXX_LIBRARY_DIRS         Optionally, the final set of library directories listed in one variable for use by client code.  This should not be a cache entry.
# XXX_ROOT_DIR           	 Where to find the base directory of XXX.
# XXX_VERSION_YY		       Expect Version YY if true. Make sure at most one of these is ever true.
# XXX_WRAP_YY		           If False, do not try to use the relevent CMake wrapping command.
# XXX_YY_FOUND           	 If False, optional YY part of XXX sytem is not available.
# XXX_FOUND              	 Set to false, or undefined, if we haven't found, or don't want to use XXX.
# XXX_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DIRS Optionally, the runtime library search path for use when running an executable linked to shared libraries.
#                          The list should be used by user code to create the PATH on windows or LD_LIBRARY_PATH on unix.
#                          This should not be a cache entry.
