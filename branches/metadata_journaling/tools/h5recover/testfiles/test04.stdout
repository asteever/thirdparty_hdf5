Examining the putative HDF5 file test04.h5:
	test04.h5 was journaled and not closed properly.
	It is probably corrupt, and it cannot be opened by the HDF5 library.
		journaling enabled = 1
		magic = 0x30430f5c
		journal file name = "trecover.h5.jnl".

Examining the putative HDF5 journal file test04.jnl:
	the file test04.jnl is empty.

Since test04.jnl is empty, either test04.h5
already has consistent metadata and need only be marked as not having
journaling in progress so it can opened with the hdf5 library, or
test04.jnl is not really its journal file.

Unfortunately, which is true can't be determined by this program.
If you are sure you have the correct journal file, go ahead and run
test04.jnl on test04.h5.
