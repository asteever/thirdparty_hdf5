Examining the putative HDF5 file test07.h5:
	test07.h5 was journaled and not closed properly.
	It is probably corrupt, and it cannot be opened by the HDF5 library.
		journaling enabled = 1
		magic = 0x6df1c7d8
		journal file name = "trecover.h5.jnl".

Examining the putative HDF5 journal file test07.jnl:
	header in test07.jnl looks OK.

magic mismatch!!! Don't run test07.jnl on test07.h5.
