	    Installation instructions for Parallel HDF5
	    -------------------------------------------
		(last updated: April 22, 1998)

This file contains instructions for the installation of parallel
HDF5.  Platforms supported by this release are SGI Origin 2000,
IBM SP2, and the Intel TFLOP.  The steps are kind of unnatural and
will be more automized in the next release.   If you have difficulties
installing the software in your system, please send mail to
	hdfparallel@ncsa.uiuc.edu

Note:
For the users of the Intel TFLOPS machine, a special sequence of steps
for the parallel install may be found in the file:  INSTALL.ascired.
Also, MPI/MPIO information similar to that found below may be found in
INSTALL_parallel.ascired.

First, you must obtain and unpack the HDF5 source as
described in the file INSTALL.  You also need to obtain the
information of the include and library paths of MPI and MPIO
software installed in your system since the parallel HDF5 library
uses them for parallel I/O access.

For an IBM SP2 system, follow the instructions in INSTALL.ibm.sp.parallel.
For an SGI Origin 2000 system, use the following shell commands.  (The
one shown here is what works in the NCSA O2K machine in which MPI library
is installed in system area but no official MPIO software is available.
I use a private installation of ROMIO for it.)

mpi1_inc=""					#mpi-1 include
mpi1_lib=""					#mpi-1 library
mpio_inc="-I$HOME/ROMIO/include"		#mpio include
mpio_lib="-L$HOME/ROMIO/lib/IRIX64/"		#mpio library

MPI_INC="$mpi1_inc $mpio_inc"
export MPI_INC
MPI_LIB="$mpi1_lib $mpio_lib"
export MPI_LIB

./configure --enable-parallel
