# A simple script to reconfigure autotools for HDF5.
# The autotools include a reconfigure script, but this script
# has the paths of autoconf and automake hardcoded to work on HDF
# machines.  Thus it enforces that HDF5 always uses the
# same versions of autotools.
# Uses autoconf version 2.60

# HDF5 currently uses the following versions of the autotools:
AUTOCONF_VERSION="autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.60"
AUTOHEADER_VERSION="autoheader (GNU Autoconf) 2.60"
ACLOCAL_VERSION="aclocal (GNU automake) 1.9.6"
LIBTOOL_VERSION="(GNU libtool) 1.5.14"


# If the user has defined environment variables pointing to the autotools,
# use those (but check their versions first!). Otherwise, assume that
# we're running on a machine with access to the autotools in home1/packages.
