# A simple script to reconfigure autotools for HDF5.
# The autotools include a reconfigure script, but this script
# has the paths of autoconf and automake hardcoded to work on HDF
# machines.  Thus is enforces that HDF5 always uses the
# same versions of autotools.
# Uses autoconf version 2.59

# The autotools live in AFS, so as long as their paths don't change
# and this machine has the right version of m4, this script should
# be able to run the autotools.


  # Run commands in order
