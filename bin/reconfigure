# A script to reconfigure autotools for HDF5, and to recreate other
# generated files specifc to HDF5.
# If the paths of the autotools are not specified by the user, they
# are hardcoded to point to their locations in AFS on HDF5 Linux machines.
# Users can specify the locations of the autotools with the following
# variables:
# AUTOCONF, AUTOMAKE, ACLOCAL, AUTOHEADER should be the path to the
# corresponding tools.
# LIBTOOL_DIR should be the path to the base libtool directory;
# $LIBTOOL_DIR/bin/libtool should invoke libtool, while
# $LIBTOOL_DIR/share/aclocal needs to be included by aclocal.
# Be very careful when specifying these tools manually!  There are a lot
# of versions that can get confused (not even counting the m4 utility)!

# HDF5 currently uses the following versions of the autotools:
# Uses automake (and aclocal) version 1.9.5
# Uses autoconf (and autoheader) version 2.59
# Includes macros from libtool version 1.5.14
#
# When upgrading automake's version, don't forget to also update its
# helper utilities, especially depcomp.

# If the user has defined environment variables pointing to the autotools,
# use those (but check their versions first!).  Otherwise, assume that
# we're running on a Linux box with access to the autotools in AFS.
