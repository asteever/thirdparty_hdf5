		File Recovery Readme Notes
		--------------------------

1. Known Issues
===============

1.1. The HDF5 file must be created with the latest Library version format in
     order to support the Journaling feature. Use
	H5Pset_libver_bounds(faccpl, H5F_LIBVER_LATEST, H5F_LIBVER_LATEST)
     to set up a file access property list to be used by H5Fcreate.
     -AKC 2008/6/17-

1.2. If a file is not of the latest library version and is opened with
     Journaling enabled, the library does not report any error until much
     later. H5Fopen() needs to return error if Journaling is requested but
     the file is not of the latest libary version. -AKC 2008/6/17-

1.3. Journal library is printing error output not using the H5Epush() and
     is printing to stdout, not stderr.  This is causing confusion as the
     position of those error codes are out of sync with the error messages
     from the H5E system.  For example,
     ======= non-standard error output ===============
     H5C2_begin_journaling: H5C2_mark_journaling_in_progress() failed.
     H5C2_begin_transaction H5C2_begin_journaling() failed.
     ======= end ==============
