Examining the putative HDF5 file test01.h5:
	test01.h5 was journaled and not closed properly.
	It is probably corrupt, and it cannot be opened by the HDF5 library.
		journaling enabled = 1
		magic = 0x60622d70
		journal file name = "trecover.h5.jnl".

Examining the putative HDF5 journal file test01.jnl:
	header in test01.jnl looks OK.

magics match -- test01.jnl seems to be the
journal file generated by test01.h5.
Recomend running test01.jnl on test01.h5.
