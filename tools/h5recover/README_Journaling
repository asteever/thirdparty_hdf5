	HDF5 Metadata Journaling Alpha1 Release

Feature Description
===================
The metadata journaling feature will keep a journal file of metadata being
written to an HDF5 file. Whenever the HDF5 file is flushed (H5Fflush)
or closed (H5Fclose) successfully, that is all metadata are written to
the file for sure, the journal file will be reset anew.

If the application that opens the HDF5 file crashes before the file is
closed, the file could be in an unstable state. If the file has been opened with
journaling enabled, the user can recover the file by the h5recover tool
with the journal file. All metadata are guaranteed to be stable but
rawdata modifications are not.

Release Description
===================
This is an alpha1 release. The Metadata Journaling feature is implemented
and is available for friendly users test. Be advised that there may be
further changes of the programming API and the file format. Therefore,
users are advised to use this release for testing purpose only.

How to use the Metadata Journaling feature
==========================================
An example application using the Metadata Journaling feature is
included in the source code as tools/h5recover/enable_journaling.c. To
enable Metadata Journaling, one should copy the function routine,
set_journaling(), to its own application program code and call
set_journaling() as demonstrated in the enable_journaling.c example.

To test run the enable_journaling example, follow these steps
(assuming the hdf5 library is installed in the following location,
/projects/sio/acheng/HDF5/MDJ_a1/tbird):

% /projects/sio/acheng/HDF5/MDJ_a1/tbird/bin/h5cc enable_journaling.c -o enable_journaling
% ./enable_journaling -c	# create the data file, JournalEG.h5
% ./enable_journaling -w	# write more rows to the data file.
				# Interrupt the application at any point.
% /projects/sio/acheng/HDF5/MDJ_a1/tbird/bin/h5dump JournalEG.h5	# h5dump would fail
% /projects/sio/acheng/HDF5/MDJ_a1/tbird/bin/h5recover -j JournalEG.h5.jnl JournalEG.h5		# recover the data file with the Journaling file
% /projects/sio/acheng/HDF5/MDJ_a1/tbird/bin/h5dump JournalEG.h5	# h5dump would succeed now.
% ./enable_journaling -w	# can write more rows to the data file again.
