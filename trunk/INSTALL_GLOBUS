		Installation Instructions for Remote-Accessing HDF5 

I. Overview
-----------
This file contains instructions for remote-accessing HDF5.  The SGI IRIX64
(and IRIX) 6.5 platform have been tested.  If you have difficulties installing
the software in your system, please send mails to me(Raymond Lu) at
        slu@ncsa.uiuc.edu

First, you must obtain and unpack the HDF5 source as described in the file 
INSTALL.  You need the Globus 1.1.x and SSL(should have come with Globus) 
packages.  

HDF5 is built on the top of Globus-GASS(1.1.x) to handle remote access.  
Globus-GASS(1.1.x) only supports HTTP and HTTPS protocals for 'whole file 
read and write'.  More features may be added in the future.  

II. Installation Steps
----------------------
The installation steps are similar to the ones in INSTALL file:

1. Run 'configure' file with SSL and GASS options:
   configure --with-ssl=$SSL/lib --with-gass=$GASS/include,$GASS/lib
   where $SSL is your SSL directory, and $GASS is your Globus directory.

   For example, below is a script file to run 'configure':
	#! /bin/sh
	# how to configure to use the Globus-GASS(1.1.x)

	GASS_DIR=/usr/local/globus-install-1.1.1/development/mips-sgi-irix6.5-64_nothreads_standard_debug
	SSL_LIB=/usr/local/ssl/lib

	configure --with-ssl=$SSL_LIB --with-gass=$GASS_DIR/include,$GASS_DIR/lib

2. Run 'make'

3. Run testing program:
   There is one read testing program called 'gass_read' in the 'test' 
   directory.  It does whole file read through HTTP protocal.  The URL is 
   hard coded as 
      http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/GLOBUS/a.h5

   The writing really depends on your web server.  You have to set up your 
   server in right way to accept writing in files.  We have tested it using 
   Apache Server(1.3.12) without authentication.  If you need more details 
   about our testing, please contact us.  Globus suggests using their GASS
   server. 

   There is another program called 'gass_append' used for experiments.
