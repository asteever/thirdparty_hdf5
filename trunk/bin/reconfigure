# A simple script to reconfigure autotools for HDF5.
# The autotools include a reconfigure script, but this script
# has the paths of autoconf and automake hardcoded to work on HDF
# machines.  Thus is enforces that HDF5 always uses the
# same versions of autotools.
# Uses automake version 1.9.5
# Uses autoconf version 2.59
# Includes macros from libtool version 1.4.2
#
# When upgrading automake's version, don't forget to also update its
# helper utilities, especially depcomp.

# The autotools live in AFS, so as long as their paths don't change
# and this machine has the right version of m4, this script should
# be able to run the autotools.

# Add the correct version of autoconf binaries to path (otherwise aclocal
# may find an outdated version of autom4ate and complain about an
# "unknown language": Autoconf-without-aclocal-m4.
