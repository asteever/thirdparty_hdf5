WARNING!!  WARNING!!  WARNING!!  WARNING!!  WARNING!!  WARNING!!  WARNING!!

This code is currently using interim file format changes that will
certainly change before the final 1.8.0 release.  Please feel free to
test everything out (in fact, we'd welcome that!), but do _NOT_ keep any
of the files produced as they will not be readable by later versions of
the HDF5 software.
