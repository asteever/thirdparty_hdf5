# The following rules insure that the Makefile is up-to-date by rerunning
# various autoconf components (although not all versions of make assume
# that the makefile is implicitly a target).  We use time stamp files to
# keep track of the most recent update of H5config.h.in and H5config.h
# because autoheader and config.status don't update the modification time
# if the contents don't change.
#
# Graphically, the dependencies are:

##############################################################################
#			    T A R G E T S
#
# all:		Build libraries, header files, and programs in the various
#		subdirectories but do not install them.
#
# test:		Test the uninstalled library to make sure it works.
#
# install:	Installs libraries, header files, programs, and documentation
#		in the various directories under the prefix directory (lib,
#		include, bin, man, info).  Use the `--prefix=PATH' option
#		to `configure' (or `config.status') or say `--help' for
#		other alternatives.  The default prefix is `/usr/local'.
#
# uninstall:	Delete all the installed files that the `install' target
#		created (but not the noninstalled files such as `make all'
#		created).
#
# clean:	Removes temporary files except those that record the
#		configuration and those that are part of the distribution.
#
# mostlyclean:	Like `clean' except it doesn't delete a few files like
#		libraries, programs, and/or generated header files because
#		regenerating them is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.
#
# distclean:	Deletes all files that are created by configuring or building
#		HDF5.  If you have unpacked the source and built HDF5 without
#		creating any other files, then `make distclean' will leave
#		only the files that were in the distrubution.
#
# maintainer-clean:
#		Like `distclean' except it deletes more files.  It deletes
#		all generated files.  This target is not intended for normal
#		users; it deletes files that may require special tools to
#		rebuild.
#
# TAGS:		Updates the tags table for this program.
#
# dep depend:	Builds dependencies in all subdirectories.  These targets
#		might not be available on certain combinations of make
#		programs and C compilers.  At the other extreme, the GNU
#		make used in combination with gcc will maintain dependency
#		information automatically.
