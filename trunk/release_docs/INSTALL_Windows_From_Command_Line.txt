from Command Line on Windows XP

************************************************************************
Note: This instruction is written for users who would like to build HDF5
      libraries and tools from the HDF5 source code package on command
      line.
         
      Currently, we support 
      
      1. Building and testing HDF5 on command line with Microsoft Visual 
         C++ 6.0 and Compaq Visual Fortran 6.0.
      
      2. Building and testing HDF5 C and C++ Library on command line with
         Microsoft Visual C++ .Net (2003)
         
      3. Building and testing HDF5 C and C++ Library on command line with
         Intel C++ Compiler 8.1 integration with Microsoft Visual C++ .Net
         2003.
      
      For all other Windows development tools, HDF5 should be built in
      the development environment.  Please refer to INSTALL_Windows.txt
      for detailed HDF5 building and installation information, or 
      INSTALL_Windows_short.txt for quick HDF5 building and installation

   Go to  c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows and run copy_hdf.bat. 
      
2. Building and testing HDF5 libraries and tools

   We provide 2 options for users to build test HDF5 libraries 
   and tools.
      
    2.1 Options A: Build and test in one step 
      
         A batch file named hdf5bt.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory
         is provided for users to build and test HDF5 library and tools
         together from command line.

         hdf5bt.bat has four options:

            hdf5bt                 build and test C library and tools

            hdf5bt enablecpp       build and test C/C++ libraries 
                                   and tools

            hdf5bt enablefortran   build and test C/Fortran libraries
                                   and tools

            hdf5bt enableall       build and test C/C++/Fortran 
                                   libraries and tools

         Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5bt with
         appropriate options.

         Test results are saved in two files:

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5_results.txt   

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt.

         In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.
         If all the tests passed, then you do not have to check
         hdf5_results.txt.  If some tests failed, check
         hdf5_results.txt can help you figure out what was wrong.

    2.2 Options B: Build and test in two steps 

         We also provide users with the option to build and test 
         HDF5 libraries and tools seperately.
   
         Step 1) Build HDF5 Libraries and Tools

            A batch file named hdf5build.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 
            directory is provided for users to build HDF5 library and 
            tools from command line.

               hdf5build enablecpp       build HDF5 C/C++ libraries 
                                         and tools

               hdf5build enablefortran   build HDF5 C/Fortran libraries
                                         and tools

               hdf5build enableall       build HDF5 C/C++/Fortran 
                                         libraries and tools

            Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5build with 
            appropriate options.  Compiling outputs are saved in 
            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\build_results.txt.  You can check 
            the file to find out whether there are any compilation
            errors.

         Step 2) Test HDF5 Libraries and Tools
   
            A batch file named hdf5check.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5
            directory is provided for users to test HDF5 library 
            and tools from command line.

            hdf5check.bat has four options:

               hdf5check                 test HDF5 C library and tools
      
               hdf5check enablecpp       test HDF5 C/C++ libraries 
                                         and tools
      
               hdf5check enablefortran   test HDF5 C/Fortran libraries
                                         and tools
      
               hdf5check enableall       test HDF5 C/C++/Fortran 
                                         libraries and tools

            Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with 
            appropriate options.

            Test results are saved in two files:

               c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt   

               c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\check_results.txt.

            In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.  If
            all the tests passed, then you do not have to check 
            check_results.txt. If some tests failed, check 
            check_results.txt can help you figure out what was wrong.
