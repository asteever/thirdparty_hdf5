*      Instructions for Building and Testing HDF5 on Windows XP        *
*                          (From Command Line)                         *
************************************************************************
Note: This instruction is written for users who would like to build HDF5
      libraries and tools from the HDF5 source code package on command
      line.
         
      Currently, we support 
      
      1. Building and testing HDF5 on command line with Microsoft Visual 
         Studio .NET
      
      
      For all other Windows development tools, HDF5 should be built in
      the development environment.  Please refer to INSTALL_Windows.txt
      for detailed HDF5 building and installation information, or 
      INSTALL_Windows_short.txt for quick HDF5 building and installation
      instructions.
                        
WARNINGS:

Please read CAREFULLY about HDF5 build and install preconditions and 
notes in INSTALL_Windows.txt before starting below procedures.


========================================================================
   Section I: Building and testing HDF5 on command line with Microsoft 
              Visual Studio .NET
========================================================================
    
1. Preconditions: 

   1.1 Verify environment for Visual Studio .NET
   
   Building from the command line requires environment variables for Visual
   Studio.  These are generally setup when Visual Studio is installed, but you
   can verify by running the command:
        
        echo %vs71comntools%
        
    This should output a path similar to:
    
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Common7\Tools\
      
   1.2 Run batch file copy_hdf.bat.

   Go to  c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows and run copy_hdf.bat. 
      
2. Building and testing HDF5 libraries and tools

   We provide 2 options for users to build and test HDF5 libraries 
   and tools.
      
    2.1 Options A: Build and test in one step 
      
         A batch file named hdf5bt.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory is 
         provided for users to build and test HDF5 library and tools together 
         from command line.

         hdf5bt.bat currently takes no parameters:

            hdf5bt                 build and test C/C++ library and tools

         Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5bt.  Test results are saved 
         in two files:

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\check_results.txt   

            c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt.

         In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.  If all the tests 
         passed, then you do not have to check check_results.txt.  If some tests 
         failed, check check_results.txt can help you figure out what was wrong.

    2.2 Options B: Build and test in two steps 

         We also provide users with the option to build and test HDF5 libraries 
         and tools seperately.
   
         Step 1) Build HDF5 Libraries and Tools

            A batch file named hdf5build.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 
            directory is provided for users to build HDF5 library and 
            tools from command line.

            hdf5build.bat currently takes no parameters:
  
               hdf5build                 build HDF5 C/C++ library and tools

            Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5build.  Compiling outputs 
            are saved in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\build_results.txt.  You can check 
            the file to find out whether there are any compilation errors.

         Step 2) Test HDF5 Libraries and Tools
   
            A batch file named hdf5check.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5
            directory is provided for users to test HDF5 library 
            and tools from command line.

            hdf5check.bat has four options:
            
            hdf5check                 Test HDF5 C Libraries and Tools

            hdf5check enablecpp       Test HDF5 C/C++ Libraries and Tools

            hdf5check enablefortran   Test HDF5 C/Fortran Libraries
                                      and Tools

            hdf5check enableall       Test HDF5 C/C++/Fortran Libraries
                                      and Tools

            Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with apropriate 
            options.

            Test results are saved in two files:

        	   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt   

	           c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\check_results.txt.
			
            In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.  If all the 
            tests passed, then you do not have to check check_results.txt. If 
            some tests failed, check check_results.txt can help you figure out 
            what was wrong.

3. Installing HDF5 Libraries

Run the batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\installhdf5lib.bat to install all
HDF5 libraries and tools into c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib directory.
