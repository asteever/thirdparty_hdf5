	1.Obtaining HDF5
	  Please see INSTALL file in this directory for downloading instructions.

	2. Building C, Fortran and C++ libraries
	   Use tar command to untar HDF5 source ball

		tar -xvf hdf5-1.8.0-<pre>.tar
	   Change default directory to [.hdf5-1.8.0-<pre>.vms]
           and run 
		@make
           command. This command file will build 
			C library, tests, and utilities	
			Fortran library and tests
			C++ library and tests
			C, Fortran and C++ examples

	   IMPORTANT: Compilations flags are defined in the [.vms]make.com file of the
	   source tree. It is set up to use /float=float_ieee qualifier for C, Fortran 
	   and C++ compilersi, and debug mode. If desired, those flags can be removed.
	   Do NOT REMOVE /define=H5_VMS and /standard=strict_ansi qualifiers.
	   If you have to use make.com file in a particular directory, make sure that
	   you modify the compilation flags in this file appropriately.

	   If  make.com succeeds, the following libraries and utilties will be built:

	   [.src]hdf5.olb
	   [.fortran.src]hdf5_fortran.olb
	   [.c__.src]hdf5_cplus.olb
	   [.tools.h5diff]h5diff.exe
	   [.tools.h5dump]h5dump.exe
	   [.tools.h5import]h5import.exe
	   [.tools.h5jam]h5jam.exe
	   [.tools.h5jam]h5unjam.exe
	   [.tools.h5ls]h5ls.exe
	   [.tools.h5repack]h5repack.exe

	3. Testing HDF5 libraries and tools
	   You may try to run check.com files in the following directories

	   [.test]
	   [.fortran.test]
	   [.c__.test]
	   [.examples]
	   [.fortran.examples]
	   [.c__.examples]

	4. Installing HDF5 libraries
	   Currently one has manually copy *.olb, public *.h files and Fortran modules 
	   files from 
           [.src], [.fortran.src] and [.c__.src] directories

	5. Known problems

	   1. There is no support for filters including deflated compression filter and
	      szip compression filters
	   2. There are few C and Fortran tests that fail (C mtime,  Fortran file_close and
              multifile driver tests, probably more; all major tests succeed)
	   3. Mulitifile driver has not been tested yet
	   4. Test scripts for some tools are missing; existing tools test scripts
	      do not compare output with the expected output.
	   5. Probably more :-)
