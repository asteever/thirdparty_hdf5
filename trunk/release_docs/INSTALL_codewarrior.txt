Instructions to build the HDF5 library, tests and tools on Metrowerks Code Warrior.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As of version 1.4.2 of the HDF5 library, HDF5 is now supported on the Metrowerks 
Code Warrior 6.0 compiler.

These instructions assume you have some basic knowledge of the Code Warrior compiler.
1. Open the project file hdf5.mcp (it is located in hdf5/proj/codewarrior)
2. Building the library.
	Select the hdf5 target and build (menu Projects-> Make or F7 key).
3. Building all the targets (HDF5 library, test and tools).
	Select the all target and build.
4. Running the tests on a command line window
	On a command line window, change directory to hdf5\test. Type 
	Hdf5test debug
	Or 
	Hdf5test debug > myfile.txt
	To redirect the output to a file called myfile.txt
	The test and tools files are generated on the same directory as the ones compiled by 
	using the Microsoft Visual Studio compiler.
5. Enjoy.
