HDF5 Build and Install Instructions for Windows XP with MSVS .NET 2003
                          (Short Version)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: This short instruction is written for users who want to quickly
      build HDF5 library and tools from the HDF5 source code package
      with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 but do not want to know HDF5 
      building and installation details on Windows XP.
         
      For detailed HDF5 build and install information, or if you have
      trouble following any steps in the instructions, please refer to
      INSTALL_Windows.txt for further information.
      
      For users who would like to build and test HDF5 package from the
      command line, please refer to
      INSATLL_Windows_From_Command_Line.txt.
        
***************************WARNINGS*************************************
Please read CAREFULLY about HDF5 build and install preconditions and 
notes in INSTALL_Windows.txt before starting below procedures.
************************************************************************

Preconditions:                                                           
                                                                         
   a. Setup path Visual Studio .Net 2003 Compiler.  
   
     Open "System" in Control Panel.
   
      On the "Advanced" tab, click "Environment Variables", click 
      "Path" in the "System variables" box, then click "Edit" and 
      add your Visual C++ .Net path (For example, 
      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Common7\IDE)
      into "Variable Value" and click "OK".                          
                                                                         
   b. Set up path for external libraries and headers                     
                                                                         
    Skip this part if you don't want to use ANY compression features     
    provided by HDF5.  Please do read Section V.                         
                                                                         
    You have to read this part even if you want to only use Zlib         
    or Szip.  You also need to read Section V.                           
                                                                         
    Invoke Microsoft Visual C++ .Net and go to "Tools" and select             
    "Options". In the left pane of  "Option" window poped up,
    choose and extend "Projects", Click on "VC++ Directories".
    In the right pane, Find the box "Show directories for", choose                          
    "Include files", if you can not find your Zlib and Szip              
    header path                                                          
    (for example, c:\zlib122\include, c:\szip\include)                   
    from the directory list, add the header path                         
    (c:\zlib122\include, c:\szip\include) to the                         
    included directories.                                                
                                                                         
    Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files",         
    If you cannot find your Zlib and Szip library path                   
    (for example, c:\zlib122\lib, c:\szip\dll)                           
    from the directory list, add the library path                        
    (c:\zlib122\lib, c:\szip\dll) to the library directories.            

1. Open all.dsw workspace
   
   Notes: all.sln is for command use only. Please open all.dsw 
          not all.sln.

   Invoke Microsoft Visual C++ .Net 2003.  From the main        
   menu, go to "File" and select "Open Solution". In            
   the "Open Solution" window, Change "Files of type" to        
   "All Project Files". Choose "all.dsw" under the directory    
   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows\proj\all. In the pop up window,   
   chooise "Yes To All" to convert all project files to Visual  
   C++ .Net project format.

   Click on "OK", From the main menu, choose "Build"-> "Build" or 
   "Rebuild ALL" to build both release and debug version of HDF5
   Libraries.

3. Testing HDF5 Libraries and Tools. 

HDF5 libraries and tools should be tested to make sure that they were
built correctly.

HDF5 libraries and tools can be tested with hdf5check.bat batch file 
in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.

hdf5check.bat has four options:
   
   hdf5check                     test HDF5 C library and tools only
      
   hdf5check enablecpp           test HDF5 C/C++ libraries and tools
         
   hdf5check enablefortran       test HDF5 C/Fortran libraries 
                                 and tools
         
   hdf5check enableall           test HDF5 C/C++/Fortran libraries
                                 and tools
   

Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with appropriate
options.

Test results are saved in two files:

   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt   

   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\check_results.txt.

In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.  If all the
tests passed, then you do not have to check check_results.txt.  
If some tests failed, check check_results.txt can help you
figure out what was wrong.

If you want to test HDF5 libraries and tools one by one, please refer to
Section II, step 2 in INSTALL_Windows.txt.


STEP 3: Installing HDF5 Libraries

Run the batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\installhdf5lib.bat to install 
all HDF5 libraries and tools into c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib directory.


STEP 4: Building HDF5 Examples (Optional)

Please read Section II, step 4 in INSTALL_Windows.txt.
