# This file is part of the HDF5 build script.  It is processed shortly
# after configure starts and defines, among other things, flags for
# the various compile modes.


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Compiler flags. The CPPFLAGS values should not include package debug
# flags like `-DH5G_DEBUG' since these are added with the
# `--enable-debug' switch of configure.

# Sometimes a particular compiler must be used.  If that's the case
# then uncomment the following line.  Otherwise the main configure
# script will try to detect the compiler automatically.

# What must *always* be present for things to compile correctly?

#CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I."

# What compiler flags should be used for code development?

# What compiler flags should be used for building a production
# library?

# What compiler flags enable code profiling?

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Values for overriding configuration tests when cross compiling.
# This includes compiling on some machines where the serial front end
# compiles for a parallel back end.

# Set this to `yes' or `no' depending on whether the target is big
# endian or little endian.
#ac_cv_c_bigendian=${ac_cv_c_bigendian='yes'}

# Set this to the width required by printf() to print type `long
# long'.  For instance, if the format would be `%lld' then set it to
# `ll' or if the format would be `%qd' set it to `q'.
#hdf5_cv_printf_ll=${hdf5_cv_printf_ll='ll'}
