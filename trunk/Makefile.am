# Top-level HDF5 Makefile(.in)

# pmake has issues if variables are undefined.  Solve this problem in
# top-level Makefile by defining all variables it complains about.
# Configure should set AM_MAKEFLAGS to -V to solve this problem in
# subdirectories.
# NOTE: This means that invoking pmake in a subdirectory will not work.

# Define subdirectories to build.
## Automake understands that `make distclean' should recurse into
## conditional subdirectories even if `make all' does not.
## We need to list examples and doc in the DIST_SUBDIRS variable
## so that they also will be visited by `make distclean'
# Add this directory to SUBDIRS so that examples get built after tools
# but before examples in extra interfaces (c++ and fortran).
# Since we're explicitly listing DIST_SUBDIRS, we also need to list
# directories that are only conditionally built (so that their Makefiles
# are cleaned as well).
# Note that `make clean' will not affect the examples or doc directories. 

# Conditionals.  These conditionals are defined during configure
# Define each variable to empty if it is not used to placate pmake
