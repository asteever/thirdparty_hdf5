HDF5 log_vfd branch

Created by Dana Robinson in summer 2011.  As far as I know, I am the only
person working on this branch.

This branch is an experimental branch where an initial effort at
separating the log message/stats generation will be separated from the
underlying VFD functionality will take place.  It will be deleted after
the experiment is complete.

This branch tracks the log_vfd feature branch.  It is merged when the
log_vfd branch changes significantly.
