This branch is for investigating using WiX as the technology we use
to build our Windows installers. Unlike NSIS, WiX allows creating
.msi installers, which can be installed programmatically, allowing
us to automate their testing.

As the branch name indicates, this reature branch tracks the 1.8
branch, though it will probably be synced only rarely as the
installer is fairly orthogonal to the rest of the codebase.

This branch can be deleted once we have a plan for Wix.

This work will be tracked in JIRA issue HDFFV-9030.

Allen and Dana will probably be the key contributors.
