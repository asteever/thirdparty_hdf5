features/direct_io_2

This branch was created by Neil Fortner to support aligned memory
buffers when direct I/O is used. This work should be complete but
was performed around HDF5 1.8.8 and may need some fixing before
it can be merged.

This branch will probably be merged with the trunk and 1.8
branch in 2015 as a part of other direct VFD work.

This branches tracks the trunk. It is not regularly updated.

Please see Neil Fortner or Dana Robinson if you have questions
about this branch.
