HDF5 log_vfd branch

Created by Dana Robinson in early 2011.  As far as I know, I am the only
person working on this branch.

This branch is where improvements to the log VFD are taking place.  Since
some of these changes may not be propagated to the 1.8.x branch, they are
being made in a separate branch.

This branch tracks the trunk.  It is merged with the trunk every few days.
