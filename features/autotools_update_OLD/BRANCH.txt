autotools_update

The purpose of this branch is to make changes to the autotools files,
particularly configure.ac. This will remove a lot of old cruft and update
the input files. This effort was started in January 2015 and should be
completed within the year.

This branch tracks the trunk.

Allen is the owner of this branch, but Dana and Elena could also
possibly answer questions about this branch.
