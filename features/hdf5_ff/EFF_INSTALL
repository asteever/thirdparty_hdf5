System pre-requisites: 
	An MPI implementation that supports MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE
	Pthreads

build opa:
	It is located in the tarball in the 'openpa' directory, OR get it
        from here: git clone git://git.mcs.anl.gov/radix/openpa.git

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/path/to/opa/install/directory
	make
        make check
	make install

build AXE:
	It is located in the tarball in the 'axe' directory, OR get it from
        here: svn checkout https://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/axe/trunk

	./configure --prefix=/path/to/axe/install/directory --with-opa=/path/to/opa/install/directory
	make
        make check
	make install

build Skeletal IOD:
	It is located in the tarball in the 'iod' directory, OR get the
        tarball from the FastForward Wiki here:
        https://wiki.hpdd.intel.com/download/attachments/12125118/iod-skeleton.tgz?api=v2

	cp the iodrc file from the iod top level directory to /etc/iodrc
	make

	Note the path to the IOD install is actually just the path to the top
        source directory where you unpacked the tar file.

build iofsl function shipper
	The code is located in tarball in the 'iofsl-shipper-*' directory.

	refer to Jerome's IOFSL build recipe

build HDF5 IOD VOL plugin:
        The code is located in the tarball, in the top source directory where
        the tar file was unpacked, OR get it from here:
            svn checkout http://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/hdf5/features/iod

	./configure --with-iod=/path/to/iod/install/directory --with-axe=/path/to/axe/install/directory --with-shipper=/path/to/iofsl-shipper/install/directory --enable-parallel --enable-debug --enable-trace --enable-threadsafe --enable-unsupported --with-pthread=/path/to/pthread_library
	make
        make check
	make install

The tests are located in testpar/test_client.c and testpar/test_server.c.  The
build process should generate the executables.  The client and server need to
be launched from the same directory for now.

Launch the server first:
 mpiexec -n 1 ./test_server
then launch the client
 mpiexec -n <x> ./test_client

END
