System pre-requisites: 
	An MPI3 implementation that supports MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE
            [i.e. MPICH3 or later - we built with MPICH 3.0.2]
	Pthreads


build opa:
	It is located in the tarball in the 'openpa' subdirectory, OR get it
        from here: git clone git://git.mcs.anl.gov/radix/openpa.git

	./configure --prefix=/path/to/opa/install/directory
	make
        make check
	make install


build AXE:
	It is located in the tarball in the 'axe' subdirectory, OR get it from
        here: svn checkout https://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/axe/trunk

	./configure --prefix=/path/to/axe/install/directory --with-opa=/path/to/opa/install/directory
	make
        make check
	make install


build Skeletal IOD:
	It is located in the tarball in the 'iod' subdirectory, OR get the
        tarball from the FastForward Wiki here:
        https://wiki.hpdd.intel.com/download/attachments/12125118/iod-skeleton.tgz?api=v2

	Copy the 'iodrc' file from the top level iod directory to /etc/iodrc or
        the top-level build directory for HDF5 (e.g. hdf5_ff, if you are
        building "in-place" from the tarball).

	make

	Note the path to the IOD install (for the HDF5 build, below) is
        actually just the path to the top source directory where you build
        IOD (i.e. /path/to/your/copy/of/fastforward/iod).


build iofsl function shipper
	The code is located in tarball in the 'iofsl' subdirectory.

	Refer to Jerome's IOFSL build recipe in that subdirectory for build
        instructions.


build HDF5 IOD VOL plugin:
        The code is located in the tarball in the 'hdf5_ff' subdirectory, OR
        get it from here:
            svn checkout http://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/hdf5/features/iod

	./configure --with-iod=/path/to/iod/install/directory --with-axe=/path/to/axe/install/directory --with-shipper=/path/to/iofsl-shipper/install/directory --enable-parallel --enable-debug --enable-threadsafe --enable-unsupported --with-pthread
	make
        make check
	make install


The examples are located in testpar/test_client.c and testpar/test_server.c.  The
HDF5 build process should generate the executables.  The client and server need to
be launched from the same directory for now.

Launch the server first:
 mpiexec -n 1 ./test_server
then launch the client
 mpiexec -n <x> ./test_client

END
