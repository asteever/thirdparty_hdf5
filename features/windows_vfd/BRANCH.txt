HDF5 windows_vfd branch

Created by Dana Robinson in fall 2011.  I am the only person working on
this branch.

This branch was created for propagating the Windows VFD changes to the
POSIX- and stdio-based drivers (SEC2, log, core, direct and stdio) in
preparation for the retirement of the redundant Windows VFD.  It will
be deleted after the release of HDF5 1.8.8.

This branch tracks the trunk.  It is merged with the trunk every few days.
