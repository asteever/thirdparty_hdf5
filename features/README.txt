The purpose of this subdirectory of the HDF5 repository is to hold new "feature
branches", which are branched from the trunk and used to develop new features
in a safe, isolated place.

Each feature branch should have a "BRANCH.txt" file in its top subdirectory,
describing the purpose of the branch, and its current status.
