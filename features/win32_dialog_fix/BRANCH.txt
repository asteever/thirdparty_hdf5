This branch was created by Dana Robinson for testing a strategy
that will eliminate Windows error reporting dialog boxes when
the library is testing.

It should be a very short-lived branch and should be deleted after
the feature is incorporated into the trunk (before the HDF5 1.8.14
release).

This branch follows the trunk.

As far as I know, I am the only person using this branch.
