This purpose of this branch is to try out enabling thread-safety at run
time instead of configure time.

It was created by Dana Robinson in Dec 2014 and tracks the trunk, though
it will probably not be updated frequently.

It will be deleted either when the code is merged into the trunk or Dana
decides that the feature is not worth implementing.
