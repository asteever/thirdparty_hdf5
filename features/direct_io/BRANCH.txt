direct_io

This branch was originally created by Ray Lu (?) to add some optimizations
for direct I/O on Linux. It looks like it was at almost completed but does
not seem to have been checked back into the trunk.

This branch follows the trunk but has not been updated in some time.

Dana Robinson is the current branch owner. These changes may be merged
into the trunk and/or 1.8 branch as a part of current (as of 2015)
direct VFD work.

UPDATE: This branch is being deleted. It is superseded by the
        branches/direct_io_2 branch.
