HDF5 avoid_truncate feature branch

This branch was created by Mike McGreevy on March 24, 2011. As far as he is
aware, he is the only person working on this branch.

This branch is being used to develop a feature to allow the library to avoid
truncating an HDF5 file upon file close, an operation which has shown to have
significant performance penalties in many-process parallel applications.

This branch is off of the trunk. At this time, none of the changes in this
branch are scheduled for merge with the 1.8.x release series, since the
core avoid_truncate feature requires a file format change.

All trunk changes through r21862 have been merged up to this feature branch.
